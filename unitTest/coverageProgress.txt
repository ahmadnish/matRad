Report for the progress of coverage tests:
.
.
So far I tried different methods to do coverage tests
the most viable solution might be MOcov which is under MOunitTest
but still wasn't able to implement it 
    So I add mocov(blabla) in matRad_runTests, instead of example1
    but it gives an error regarding the some max_recursive limit
    this is how I used it
    mocov('-cover', '~/matRad/', '-expression', 'matRad_example1_photon',...
            '-cover_json_file','coverage.json',...
            '-cover_xml_file','coverage.xml',...
            '-cover_html_dir','coverage_html',
            '-method','file');

Mark and I discussed it and we agreed on discussing it with Niklas and the others


==> I should continue working on implementing the the whole MOunit test and use their .travis.yml
