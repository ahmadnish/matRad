function [ct, cst] = matRad_addMovement(ct, cst, motionPeriod, numOfCtScen, amp)
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% adds artificial sinosodal patient motion by creating a deformation vector
% field and applying it to the ct.cube by geometric transformation
%
% call
%   ct = matRad_addMovement(ct, ct.motionPeriod, ct.numOfCtScen, amp)
%
% input
%   ct:             matRad ct struct
%   cst:            matRad cst struct
%   motionPeriod:   the length of a whole breathing cycle (in seconds)
%   numOfCtScen:    number of ct phases
%   amp:            amplitude of the sinosoidal movement (in pixels)
%
%   note:           1st dim --> x LPS coordinate system
%                   2nd dim --> y LPS coordinate system
%                   3rd dim --> z LPS coordinate system
%                   a positive amplitude moves the phantom to the right,
%                   anterior, inferior
%
% output
%   ct:             modified matRad ct struct including dvf and cubes for 
%                   all phases
%   cst:            modified matRad cst struct
